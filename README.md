# KNN and Survival Analysis Based Approach to Multi-Sample Test
Applied a robust KNN-based two-sample test, utilized a weighted edge method to deal with the imbalanced data,
and improved the approach to test multiple populations by constructing intensity centered score processes

Detected the dissimilarity in 5,153-dimensional cancer data with 103 records in R, and this testing method
outperformed Hotellingâ€™s T-squared test in power by 15%-20%
